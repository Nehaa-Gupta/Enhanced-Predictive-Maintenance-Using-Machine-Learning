Enhanced-Predictive-Maintenance-Using-Machine-Learning

In this project i have developed a predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment by implementing advanced machine learning models to forecast Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and classify risk levels, optimizing maintenance schedules and reducing downtime. The main objectives of the project are:

Regression Task: Predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial machines to optimize maintenance schedules.

Classification Task: Classify machines into "Low Risk," "Moderate Risk," or "High Risk" categories based on sensor data.
